# King of Time Travel

Created C# Code and used Unity to design a video game with a mix of animation between castles and space stations. Player's avatar is a King character who is searching for the keystones to unlock the doors and find the treasure. Jump over the enemies with the king's hammer to defeat them, and stay out of the green burning liquid. The game can be played from the browser: Itch io, https://captain-garneto.itch.io/king-of-time-travel Unity Play, https://play.unity.com/en/games/73f871f1-8ae0-4ae1-8e36-ec0e8abc7d4f/king-of-time-travel
